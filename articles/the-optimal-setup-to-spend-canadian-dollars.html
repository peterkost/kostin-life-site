      The Optimal Setup to Spend Canadian Dollars Abroad
    </h1>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve traveled to over 20 countries, opened over 30 credit cards, and
      had bank accounts with all five of the big banks as well as a handful
      smaller ones. I love optimizing my banking products to get as much out of
      them as I can. This is the optimal setup for spending money abroad for
      Canadians.

      <li>Carry multiple backup cards and some USD.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h2>
    <p>
      Visa and MasterCard offer the best exchange rate possible (see the
      exchange rate comparison table bellow). Plus you will be earning rewards
      and have strong purchase protection in cases of fraud. For these reasons
      you will want to use a credit card whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all cards in Canada charge a 2.5% fee on foreign currency
      transactions (FX fee). If you plan on spending over $5000 dollars per year
      in foreign currencies or can get the annual fee waived then the following
      cards are amazing value. Otherwise you are probably better off using
      whatever card you already have since the annual fee would eat all your
      savings.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of writing this Wealthsimple have yet to open public applications to
      the card, but they held a big event last week announcing it and have
      created a public wait list. I&#39;ve had beta access to this card since
      December and it is objectively a top three card in Canada and by far the
      best card for foreign purchases.
    </p>

    <h4 id="why-this-card">Why This Card</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No foreign exchange (FX) fee</li>
      <li>2% cash back (CB)</li>
      <li>
        No annual fee (AF) with a WS balance of $100k or a monthly direct
        deposit of over $4000
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="other-benefits">Other Benefits</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        App based 2-FA: it&#39;s embarrassing that other banks don&#39;t offer
        this, but in our case this comes in extra handy incase you&#39;re unable
        to receive SMS messages while abroad
      </li>
      <li>
        Monthly deposits of cash back: I&#39;m a big fan of points so I was
        really surprised how nice it feels to see cash back instantly deposited
        into your account every month
      </li>
      <li>
        Amazing phone support: this may only apply to premium clients, but the
        few times I&#39;ve had to call in my call has been answered in under a
        minute and with no menus to traverse
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="word-of-caution">Word of Caution</h4>
    <p>
      I&#39;m concerned this card is a bit too good to be true. A fintech
      launching a 2% CB no AF card? We already went through this with Brim who
      ended up adding a 2.5% FX fee after a few years. WS have already increased
      the minimum direct deposit amount from $2k to $4k. And I&#39;d be
      surprised if they&#39;re able to generate enough revenue from their other
      services to justify waiving the AF for account balances of $100k. I&#39;m
      going to enjoy it while it lasts, but I won&#39;t be surprised to see this
      card nerfed to garbage in the next few years.

    <p>
      If you&#39;d rather deal with an established bank instead of fintech or
      want insurance coverage, then you should consider this card. There is
      usually a solid sign up bonus making it worth opening even if just for the
      first year.
    </p>

    <h4 id="why-this-card">Why This Card</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No foreign exchange fee</li>
      <li>
        1% (almost) cash back: while technically Scene points, these can be
        redeemed for a statement credit against any travel purchases which makes
        them effectively cash back
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="secondary-benefits">Secondary benefits</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        6 lounge passes: personally I find the lounges to range from fine to
        garbage, so I wouldn&#39;t put much value to them, but it&#39;s still a
        nice bonus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transaction notifications: you can enable notifications which will
        instantly show you how much your foreign purchases ended up being in
        CAD. Super convenient to keep track of spending.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insurance: major weakness of the WS VI is the lack of any travel
        insurance, if this is something you care about then this card might be
        better for you.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="additional-tips">Additional Tips</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you want to redeem your points but don&#39;t have any travel
        purchases on the card you can book a refundable hotel, apply the points,
        and then refund the hotel. This effectively makes the points straight
        cash back. Look up the refundable hotel trick for more details.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sign up bonus fine print mentions that you&#39;re ineligible for the
        bonus if you&#39;ve held the card in the last 2 years, but I suggest you
        should give it a shot anyways.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you add an authorized user (no fee) you should be able to add their
        card to the Visa Lounge app for an additional 6 passes. I&#39;ve read
        this is hit or miss, but I&#39;ve had a good experience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="cash">Cash</h2>
    <p>
      You&#39;ll always want to carry some cash just incase your cards are
      declined or they don&#39;t accept cash. However cash isn&#39;t meant to be
      your primary payment method. See &quot;This Probably Isn&#39;t For You If
      You Need Lots of Cash&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      You&#39;ll want to withdraw cash from an ATM when you arrive at your
      destination. I highly recommend doing some research beforehand, but a
      general rule of thumb is go for one of the big banks. Any card will work,
      but unless you have a premium account your bank will most likely charge
      you $5. And even with a premium account you will be paying a 2.5% foreign
      exchange fee. To avoid this I recommend opening the following two cards.
    </p>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For our purposes these cards are the same. They&#39;re both prepaid
      MasterCards with no foreign exchange fee and no ATM fees. It&#39;s really
      a no brainer to open both of them since they don&#39;t require a credit
      check and are free. That way you can have a backup if one of them is
      declined or you lose one.
    </p>
    <p>
      WS offers 1% cash back and EQ 0.5% on all purchases, however I would
      advise against using them for purchases since it&#39;s harder to get your
      money back in fraud cases.

    <h3 id="exchange-rate-comparison">Exchange Rate Comparison</h3>
    <p>
      Visa and MasterCard take a cut of all transactions which is why they are
      able to (almost) always offer the best exchange rate. As you can see
      bellow the only option even close is Wise, but it would require you to
      have a bank account in your destination country to take full advantage of.

    <p>
      I&#39;ve used wise to transfer money to a foreign bank account when I
      needed cash to pay rent. The exchange rate isn&#39;t as good as Visa or
      MasterCard, but if you have access to a foreign bank account and need to
      get large sums of money the convenience is worth the small spread. However
      for travel this is probably not an option for you.
    </p>
    <h4 id="wise-card">Wise Card</h4>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve had this card for years, but have yet to use it. I still carry it
      as a backup, but it&#39;s just objectively worse then the EQ and WS card
      since it limits you to only two free ATM withdrawals.
    </p>
    <h4 id="canada-based-usd-cards">Canada Based USD Cards</h4>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve heard that if you have a premium account with RBC you can get a
      solid exchange rate on CAD/USD, but have not tested it myself. There are
      probably some use cases for these accounts if you&#39;re frequently
      dealing with USD, but I don&#39;t think it applies to regular travel.

      From my experience I would say it&#39;s safe to assume that you will be
      able to pull $CA 200-300 per day from an ATM in most countries. If you are
      planning to do some major shopping where paying by card isn&#39;t an
      option you will most likely need to look for an alternative way to get
      cash.

      Check ATM Fees and Limits before you go

      The biggest blocker to this strategy is local ATM fees. In Vietnam I was
      paying almost exclusively in cash. This was fine since VP Bank doesn&#39;t
      charge any fees for withdrawals and has reasonably high limits. However
      I&#39;ve ran into issues in South America where all ATMs charge fees
      upwards of $CA 5 and have low withdrawal limits. This really hurts the
      exchange rate so if this applies to your destination you might want to
      consider alternatives. Unfortunately there&#39;s not a great way to get up
      to date information on ATM fees and limits. Wise has a page, but I believe
      it&#39;s restricted to holders of their card. I usually rely on old Reddit
      and Trip Advisor threads. You can also check some crowd sourced lists like

    <h4 id="always-decline-paying-in-cad">Always decline paying in CAD</h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes the ATM or payment terminal will present you with the option to
      pay in CAD instead of the local currency. <strong>ALWAYS</strong> pay in
      the local currency. Even if the card you&#39;re using charges you a FX
      fee, it is almost certainly going to be lower.

      Use Apple Pay or Insert the Card

    <p>
      I&#39;ve found that your chances of being declined go from lowest when you
      insert your card to highest when you tap your card. Apple Pay gives you to
      convenience of tapping with (from my experience) a far lower chance of
      being declined then tapping the actual card.

      provide lists of countries where the cards will not work. If you are
      traveling to any of these countries you will most likely need to bring USD
      cash with you. Be sure that it is USD, while you can get away with CAD
      cash in countries like Cuba the exchange rate will be laughably bad.

    <h4 id="always-have-backup-cards">Always Have Backup Cards</h4>
    <p>
      There is always a chance that your bank will decide that they no longer
      want to provide you the privilege of spending your money for whatever
      reason. Back before Brim added an FX fee and became a worthless pile of
      garbage I was using the card daily for months abroad when suddenly it
      decided to decline every transaction. Even after calling in and being told
      that the issue was resolved the card would still decline almost every
      transaction. I&#39;m a bit paranoid so I travel with over ten payment
      methods from different financial institutions so the chances of them all
      not working are close to zero. You don&#39;t need to be that extreme, but
      I would recommend at least three credit cards and two debit cards for ATM
      withdrawals.

      Some countries have skipped adoption of credit card terminals and gone
      with QR code mobile payments. In China credit card acceptance is very
      poor, but if you setup WeChat or AliPay you can effectively use your
      credit card to pay for everything. While in Thailand I was able to use
      about 90% card, but I&#39;ve heard they also have some sort of QR code
      payment system. You should look up if your destination has something
      similar.

      I recently learnt that technically you need to have 10,000 Baht (~$CA 420)
      on you when entering Thailand. From first hand experience I can tell you
      this is not strictly enforced, however it&#39;s worth checking if there is
      a similar requirement for your destination. In any case you should have
      some USD on you for emergencies.

      Please for the love of god if you aren&#39;t able to pay the balance in
      full every month do not use a credit card. They are literally free money
      if you use them correctly, but this is obviously subsidized by the people
      paying +20% interest. If you are one of these people it&#39;s over. Close
      the cards and pay off the balance. Know your limitations and stick to cash
      or prepaid cards like WS and EQ.
