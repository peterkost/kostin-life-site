I've been meaning to write more for years. Back in December, I purchased [kostin.life](https://kostin.life) and [kostin.dev](https://kostin.dev). I was hoping the $30/year commitment to the domain would push me over the edge to finally start publishing my work, but clearly it didn't. I have been writing, but when it comes time to publish it I start thinking about how embarrassing it is to assume that anyone would ever care about whatever it is I have to say. And you know what? No one probably does, but I can't let that stop me. The worst-case scenario is I get a bit better at writing. Which is why I'm committing to trying this out for a year. I will publish a minimum of one article a week for the next year.

## Why Now

Here's the confluence of factors that have led me to start this now.

### Scott Galloway

After reading a couple of his books I started listening to Galloway's podcasts. I don't remember where exactly but he talked about how he started his newsletter. He said he wasn't particularly good at writing, but started anyway. He set a goal of putting something out weekly because if he didn't it would take him months to write anything.

### To do X you have to DO X

In Ruby Warrington's book "Sober Curious" she kept going on about how "the only way to get unaddicted to booze is to stop drinking booze". The cliche of "if you want to do something you have to actually do it." Obviously something I've heard before. But I think the fact that this point was in the middle of ramblings about astrology and spiritual gibberish made it stick in my head as the one solid point of the book. This has nothing to do with booze, but the only way to get good at writing is to write.

### It can't be that bad

Every time I get to the end of writing an article, all I can think about is the flaws. I want to rewrite the whole thing. Or just scrap it because maybe I actually don't know anything. I can't imagine this feeling will go away so I guess I'll just deal with it. Realistically my writing can't be that bad, can it?
