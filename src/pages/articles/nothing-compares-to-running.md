I started running back in 2016. I don't remember why I started, but it was probably because of Casey Neistat's vlogs. I used to watch them daily, and besides him, I don't think I know anyone else who runs. I would consider myself a casual runner. I've never had a trainer or even watched a video on proper form. I'm not very consistent with it; I'll go for months without running. But when I am on it and running consistently, there's no better feeling. This is a bit of a ramble about why I love it.

## You can ALWAYS do it

If you go to the gym and travel frequently, you know the pain of looking for a gym that has day passes or settling for a mediocre workout with the poor excuse for a gym that most hotels have. With running, this is never an issue. Even if you can't pack running shoes, most shoes will be fine for a few short runs. A scenic path is nice, but the side of the road works just as well. It can be frustrating running through crowded streets, but if you're not focusing on pace, then it becomes its own fun challenge. If it's too hot, you can think of it as endurance training or wake up before sunrise. If it's too cold, a merino base layer and some vaseline on the face will do the trick. You can think of a million excuses not to get out there, but nothing is stopping you if you want to get some miles in.

## Guaranteed dopamine

I think it would be hard to believe if you haven't experienced it yourself, but finishing a solid run releases some kind of top-tier dopamine. I can feel like it's never been more over, but if I push myself out for a run, once it's done, I feel like we are so back and anything is possible again. The key here is that the reward comes _after_ the run. I've had plenty of runs where I feel like trash the whole time. I try to put on some banggers, but they're not doing it for me. The runner's high never comes. Radiohead on repeat the whole time. But as I hit my distance goal, I will feel better afterward. Sometimes I want to deny it and spiral further. But the improved mood is unquestionable. For me, there's no comfort food, fun activity, or conversation I can have that will come anywhere close to this feeling.

## MicrocosmÂ of any goal

Any goal can be broken down into three steps. Setting it, doing something over and over again, and achieving it. However, with any substantial goal, it can be hard to see progress or keep believing that it will all work out. With running, I set a distance and put one foot in front of the other. If I ever doubt that I can reach my goal, I look at my phone and see the distance ticking up. If I don't stop, the goal **will** be achieved. I think this carries over to all the other goals I have. There's no number to know how close I am, but I believe that the constant microcosm of goal achievement that is running trains my brain to STFU and keep putting one foot in front of the other.
