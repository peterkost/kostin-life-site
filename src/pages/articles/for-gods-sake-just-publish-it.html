      For God&#39;s Sake Just Publish It
    </h1>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve been meaning to write more for years. Back in December, I
      purchased <a href="https://www.kostin.life">kostin.life</a> and
      <a href="https://www.kostin.dev">kostin.dev</a>. I was hoping the $30/year
      commitment to the domain would push me over the edge to finally start
      publishing my work, but clearly it didn&#39;t. I have been writing, but
      when it comes time to publish it I start thinking about how embarrassing
      it is to assume that anyone would ever care about whatever it is I have to
      say. And you know what? No one probably does, but I can&#39;t let that
      stop me. The worst-case scenario is I get a bit better at writing. Which
      is why I&#39;m committing to trying this out for a year. I will publish a
      minimum of one article a week for the next year.

    <h2 id="why-now">Why Now</h2>
    <p>
      Here&#39;s the confluence of factors that have led me to start this now.
    </p>
    <h3 id="scott-galloway">Scott Galloway</h3>
    <p>
      After reading a couple of his books I started listening to Galloway&#39;s
      podcasts. I don&#39;t remember where exactly but he talked about how he
      started his newsletter. He said he wasn&#39;t particularly good at
      writing, but started anyway. He set a goal of putting something out weekly
      because if he didn&#39;t it would take him months to write anything.
    </p>
    <h3 id="to-do-x-you-have-to-do-x">To do X you have to DO X</h3>
    <p>
      In Ruby Warrington&#39;s book &quot;Sober Curious&quot; she kept going on
      about how &quot;the only way to get unaddicted to booze is to stop
      drinking booze&quot;. The cliche of &quot;if you want to do something you
      have to actually do it.&quot; Obviously something I&#39;ve heard before.
      But I think the fact that this point was in the middle of ramblings about
      astrology and spiritual gibberish made it stick in my head as the one
      solid point of the book. This has nothing to do with booze, but the only
      way to get good at writing is to write.
    </p>
    <h3 id="it-can-t-be-that-bad">It can&#39;t be that bad</h3>
    <p>
      Every time I get to the end of writing an article, all I can think about
      is the flaws. I want to rewrite the whole thing. Or just scrap it because
      maybe I actually don&#39;t know anything. I can&#39;t imagine this feeling
      will go away so I guess I&#39;ll just deal with it. Realistically my
      writing can&#39;t be that bad, can it?
